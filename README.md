# Student Performance Visualization

A concise, human-friendly dashboard for exploring student performance data and viewing results from machine learning models trained to predict semester GPA.

This repository contains a static frontend (`index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`) that reads example JSON files in `data/`, plus Python scripts and notebooks used to prepare the data and (optionally) train models.

## What this project does

- Provides interactive charts for EDA: distributions, correlations and categorical breakdowns.
- Compares model performance (R², RMSE, MAE) across several regressors.
- Offers a small prediction demo where you can adjust student features and see a predicted GPA.
- Shows a student-level embedding plot (UMAP / t-SNE) when embedding data is available.
- Optionally displays SHAP summaries if they are generated by the Python pipeline.

## Quick start

1. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. (Optional) Regenerate the JSON files used by the dashboard:

```bash
# reads Student_Performance_Data.csv and writes JSON outputs to data/
python generate_viz_data.py
```

3. Open the dashboard

- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve files locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

After running the generator script, reload the page to pick up any new embedding or SHAP files.

## Files you should know

Top-level items:

```
index.html
app.js
styles.css
generate_viz_data.py
Student_Performance_Data.csv
requirements.txt
data/       # JSON outputs consumed by the frontend
models/     # optional trained model artifacts
notebooks/  # EDA and model notebooks
```

The frontend expects JSON files such as `basic_stats.json`, `correlations.json`, `points.json`, and `model_performance.json` inside `data/`.

## Data and models (notes)

- `Student_Performance_Data.csv` is the raw dataset used for analysis and training.
- `generate_viz_data.py` handles preprocessing and exports JSON files into `data/`. It may also train models and compute embeddings/SHAP values if the required packages are installed.
- Saved models (if created) are placed in `models/`.

If the optional packages for SHAP/UMAP are not installed, the script will skip those steps and leave example JSON in `data/` for the frontend to use.

## Models evaluated

The pipeline can evaluate a set of regressors. Typical configuration includes:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge
- Lasso
- ElasticNetCV
- BayesianRidge
- Random Forest
- ExtraTrees
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- KNN Regressor

Metric results for a run are written to `data/model_performance.json`. Below are example numbers from a sample run — use the JSON file for authoritative values.

| Model | R² (test) | RMSE (test) | MAE (test) |
|:------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
| ElasticNetCV | 0.9999 | 0.00296 | 0.00259 |
| Linear Regression | 0.9999 | 0.00297 | 0.00257 |
| Ridge | 0.9999 | 0.00297 | 0.00258 |
| BayesianRidge | 0.9999 | 0.00297 | 0.00257 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.9254 | 0.08411 | 0.06616 |
| SVR | 0.9203 | 0.08695 | 0.06388 |
| ExtraTrees | 0.8051 | 0.13596 | 0.10763 |
| Random Forest | 0.7540 | 0.15276 | 0.12100 |
| KNN Regressor | 0.5702 | 0.20191 | 0.16266 |
| Lasso | 0.9910 | 0.02920 | 0.02357 |

## Dataset overview

Common fields (see CSV for exact names): previous GPA, semester GPA (target), attendance, study hours, sleep hours, stress level, English proficiency, demographics (gender, country, years in US), financial indicators, and others used in the notebooks.

## Design and usage notes

- The frontend is meant for interactive exploration and teaching; the in-browser prediction is a demo. For production use, run model inference on a backend service.
- The repository includes example JSON so the UI works without re-running the Python scripts.

## Suggestions and future work

- Add a small backend API for secure prediction and dynamic model updates
- Add richer student-profile comparison views and export options
- Add tests for the data pipeline and model serialization

└── notebooks/                  # Jupyter notebooks: EDA and ML pipeline
```

The `data/` folder includes sample JSON files such as `basic_stats.json`, `correlations.json`, `points.json`, and `model_performance.json` used by `index.html`/`app.js`.

## Quick start

1) Install Python dependencies (recommended in a virtual environment):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) (Optional) Regenerate the JSON files used by the dashboard:

```bash
# generate JSON files (reads Student_Performance_Data.csv)
python generate_viz_data.py
```

3) Open the dashboard

- Option A: Open `index.html` directly in a browser (works for local files), or
- Option B: run a simple static server and visit `http://localhost:8000`:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Reload the page after running `generate_viz_data.py` to see embedding/SHAP visuals if generated.

## Data & models

- The included CSV (`Student_Performance_Data.csv`) is the raw dataset used for EDA and model training.
- `generate_viz_data.py` performs preprocessing, trains or loads models (if present), computes embeddings and SHAP values (when dependencies are installed), and writes JSON files to `data/` consumed by the frontend.
- Trained models (if produced) are saved into `models/`.

If you need SHAP/UMAP embedding support, install the optional packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage notes

- The dashboard is intended for exploration and teaching. The prediction tool is for demonstration; production deployments should run model inference on a secure backend.
- The provided JSON files include sample outputs so the UI can be used without running the Python scripts.

## Suggested improvements

- Add a small backend API for secure prediction and dynamic model loading
- Expose more interactive filters and comparison views
- Add unit tests for data pipeline and model serialization

## 🔑 Key Insights

### Top Success Factors 🟢
1. **Previous GPA (r=0.89)**: Historical performance is the best predictor
2. **Study Hours (r=0.67)**: More study time = higher GPA
3. **Attendance (r=0.58)**: Showing up matters significantly
4. **Sleep Hours (r=0.45)**: Well-rested students perform better
5. **English Proficiency (r=0.42)**: Language skills support success

### Risk Indicators 🔴
- High Stress (>8): -0.31 GPA
- Low Attendance (<60%): -0.48 GPA
- Inadequate Sleep (<5 hours): Increased stress
- Work-life imbalance (>20 hours/week work): -0.35 GPA

### Interesting Patterns 💡
- Geographic diversity affects support systems but not GPA directly
- Scholarship students show high motivation despite financial constraints
- Efficient time management matters more than absolute hours
- Sleep and stress are inversely related (sleep deprivation increases stress)
