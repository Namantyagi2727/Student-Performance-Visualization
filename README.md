# Student Performance Visualization | ML Analytics Dashboard

An interactive machine learning visualization project for **CS-GY 9223: Visualization for Machine Learning** at NYU.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project builds a comprehensive visualization dashboard that:
- **Analyzes student performance data** (999 students, 27 features)
- **Trains 8 different ML models** to predict semester GPA
- **Creates interactive visualizations** inspired by the UMAP tutorial website
- **Provides interpretable insights** about factors affecting academic success

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Interactive correlation analysis
- Feature distributions
- Statistical summaries
- Categorical feature breakdowns

### 2. Machine Learning Models
- **8 Regression Models**: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, SVR, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, CatBoost
- **Model Comparison**: R² scores, RMSE, MAE metrics
- **Feature Importance**: Top predictors identified
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting (R² = 0.824, RMSE = 0.312)

### 3. Interactive Visualizations
- Bar charts for correlations and feature importance
- Histograms for GPA distribution
- Model performance comparisons
- Real-time prediction tool
 - UMAP / t-SNE embedding scatter (D3 + SVG) with brushing
 - Interactive demographic filters (gender, country) with linked highlighting
 - SHAP summary chart (if `shap` package installed and `generate_viz_data.py` is run)

# Student Performance Visualization

A compact, interactive dashboard that explores and visualizes a student performance dataset and the results of machine learning models trained to predict semester GPA.

This repository contains the visualization frontend (HTML/CSS/JS), example JSON data used by the dashboard, and the Python scripts/notebooks used to prepare the data and train models.

## Features
- Interactive EDA: distributions, correlations and categorical breakdowns
- Model comparison: R², RMSE, MAE across several regressors
- Prediction tool: tweak student features and see predicted GPA
- Embedding scatter (UMAP/t-SNE) for student-level visualization
- SHAP summary visualizations (optional, generated by Python)

## Files & structure

Key files and folders:

```
Student-Performance-Visualization/
├── index.html                 # Frontend dashboard
├── styles.css                 # Styling
├── app.js                     # Dashboard logic and interactivity
├── generate_viz_data.py       # Script to process CSV and export JSON used by the UI
├── Student_Performance_Data.csv # Raw dataset (source CSV)
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies for data generation
├── data/                      # Generated JSON files consumed by the dashboard
├── models/                    # Trained model artifacts (optional)
└── notebooks/                  # Jupyter notebooks: EDA and ML pipeline
```

The `data/` folder includes sample JSON files such as `basic_stats.json`, `correlations.json`, `points.json`, and `model_performance.json` used by `index.html`/`app.js`.

## Quick start

1) Install Python dependencies (recommended in a virtual environment):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) (Optional) Regenerate the JSON files used by the dashboard:

```bash
# generate JSON files (reads Student_Performance_Data.csv)
python generate_viz_data.py
```

3) Open the dashboard

- Option A: Open `index.html` directly in a browser (works for local files), or
- Option B: run a simple static server and visit `http://localhost:8000`:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Reload the page after running `generate_viz_data.py` to see embedding/SHAP visuals if generated.

## Data & models

- The included CSV (`Student_Performance_Data.csv`) is the raw dataset used for EDA and model training.
- `generate_viz_data.py` performs preprocessing, trains or loads models (if present), computes embeddings and SHAP values (when dependencies are installed), and writes JSON files to `data/` consumed by the frontend.
- Trained models (if produced) are saved into `models/`.

If you need SHAP/UMAP embedding support, install the optional packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage notes

- The dashboard is intended for exploration and teaching. The prediction tool is for demonstration; production deployments should run model inference on a secure backend.
- The provided JSON files include sample outputs so the UI can be used without running the Python scripts.

## Suggested improvements

- Add a small backend API for secure prediction and dynamic model loading
- Expose more interactive filters and comparison views
- Add unit tests for data pipeline and model serialization
